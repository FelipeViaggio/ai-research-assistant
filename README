#  Smart Content Research Assistant

Multi-agent system for intelligent research with human-in-the-loop validation and cost optimization.

##  What This Does

This system researches any topic you provide, identifies key subtopics, lets **you decide** which ones to investigate further, and generates a comprehensive Markdown report.

**Key capabilities:**
- Multi-agent architecture with 4 specialized AI agents
- Human validation at critical decision points
- Intelligent cost optimization (~80% savings vs baseline)
- Professional reports in Markdown format

- Groq API key (free - get it at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com))

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**
```bash
cd research-assistant
```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
```bash
# Create venv
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (Linux/Mac)
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure API key**
```bash
# Copy example config
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Groq API key:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here
```

**Get your free Groq API key:**
1. Go to https://console.groq.com/
2. Sign up (free)
3. Create API key
4. Copy to `.env`

##  Running the System
```bash
python main.py
```

The system will prompt you for a research topic and guide you through the process.

##  How to Use

### 1. Enter a Topic
When prompted, enter any research topic:
```
Tema: Artificial Intelligence in Education
```

### 2. Review Subtopics
The system will present 4-6 subtopics it identified.

### 3. Make Your Decision
Use these commands to control the research direction:

**Basic commands:**
- `approve 1,3,5` - Research only topics 1, 3, and 5
- `reject 2` - Exclude topic 2
- `approve all` - Research all topics
- `approve all except 2,3` - All topics except 2 and 3

**Advanced commands:**
- `add 'Custom Topic Name'` - Add your own research direction
- `modify 1 to 'New Title'` - Change a subtopics title

### 4. Get Your Report
The system generates a professional Markdown report saved in `./reports/`
